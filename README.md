# Welcome to Seekerz

A Job Tracker App for the Active Job Seeker.  Seekerz was created for users that are in the job hunt, to help organize that process. A user can log in and add a position they are applying for.  A user can add tasks to that position and archive that position when it is no longer on the table.  I invite you to check it out!
